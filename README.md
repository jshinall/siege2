Siege 2 - a Natural Selection 2 mod

# The License!
* If you work for UWE, you're not allowed to touch it. Much less steal it. [YOU KNOW WHY.]
* This is a starting point for a **CLEAN-SHEET** implementation. There will be a TOTAL rework.
* If you want to add another mod, EXTERNALIZE IT! No code theft! (Or get permission!)
* If you run a server that charges for reserved slots (donations are charging!) we expect you to...
  * Donate money equivalent to one reserved slot to us to help fund development and costs
  * Report any and all bugs to us directly. Bonus points for sending a pull request! We'll fix it.

# Siege! Siege! Siege!
Siege is back! With fun put back in! No more auto-commanding, no more dropship bullshit. Good ol' classic Siege, much closer to the _original_ siege. Because you know what? It was **fun**. And we are bringing fun back. By blowing up hives and goring marines and occasionally showing them 45 seconds of Onos Anus(TM).

# Krieger Kredits
Kredits are back! Now with 100% more fun! Abuse will be welcomed (and configurable because Krieger wants to do his 8 hive drop sooner or later.) This will be a separable, configurable module. Later.
